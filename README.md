# York UK Hosting Fork v1.1.0-YUH

This is a fork of v1.1.0 created by York UK Hosting. The fork implements 
the following:

1. Fixes the callback 500 error
2. Account level billing rather than product/service level. A single
   agreement can then used to bill for any invoice.
3. Supression of 'payment failed' emails to prevent confusion
4. Support to request GoCardless payments X days ahead of invoice due date
   to ensure payments are received by the due date rather than after.
5. Store the PreAuth in a separate table so that GoCardless can be used
   alongside a credit/debit card within a single account.

Installation:

The contents of GoCardless_WHMCS directory needs to be copied to the
/modules/gateway directory. The gocardless_hook.php file in the gocardless
subdirectory should be moved to /includes/hooks and the two parameters
modified as required.

v6 compatibility - It has not been tested but it uses init.php and does
not use any templates so will hopefully work. If you do test let me
know the outcome - github@yorkukhosting.com.

# Announcement

__As of 15th August 2013, the GoCardless WHMCS module will no longer be supported.__
You are, however, welcome to continue using the module indefinitely. 

If changes to WHMCS break the module, it is likely that we will release fixes,
but technical assistance will not be available.

The module is open source, so anyone is welcome to modify and distribute the
module as they see fit.

## GoCardless WHMCS Module

The GoCardless WHMCS module provides a simple way to use GoCardless from within WHMCS.

instructions in the first couple of lines of the file.
